# Troll Engine Andrych

Hello guys this is me burgerballs, this here is the fork i use for my fnf mods.
As troll engine is already perfect i kinda only needed to change small tiny things to make it easier for me.

As this is my own personal fork, expect bloat, this is meant to be used by nobody aside from me!

I've modified the `install_haxelibs` files, before building you should check them out.

NOTE: Do not treat this as an official release!!! This version of the engine is unendorsed by the original creators.

# QNA

Some questions might be asked about this fork in particular. So I might answer them here. 

Q: Why not PR these changes to Troll Engine

A: As a programmer I understand that what I'm doing is best described as bloat in some reigonal dialects.
It isn't best to do add changes for an engine only I use to it's base version for this reason.

Q: Why not just use X or Y Engine

A: I don't want to.

Q: Why is it called Andrych?

A: That's the old name of Troll Engine! I decided to choose that name internally to differentiate it
from original Troll in order to prevent confusion, BUT in a way I think still brings attention to the
original in a spiritual fashion.
